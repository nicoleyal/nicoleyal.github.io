            <h2>Light projected zoetrope</h2>

            <h3>The concept</h3>
            <p>
              In the lamp project and the moving parts project I came across things I wanted to explore further. In particular, reflected light and spinning motion.

            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
              While working on the moving parts project I had thought about making a zoetrope (device that produces the illusion of motion by displaying a sequence of drawings or photographs showing progressive phases of that motion).
              <br>
              <br>
              Zoetropes use a similar technology to a flip book, but they possess a circular shape and a strobe light to shine on each image as it rapidly passes by. Because you are looking through a cut out slit for each image, it turns into a frame rate which animates the images.
              <br>
              <br>
              Additionally, the reflected light that was a by-product of my lantern actually became the most interesting part of my lamp. So as I was brainstorming I ended up with this idea to play with projected light and motion.
              I started by putting my previous project parts together to see what effects I could produce.

            <h3>Use case</h3>
            <p>
              This is an entertaining and explorative device that will be used in a mostly dark room to learn more about animation and the mathematical relationship to and object and light shined through that object.<br>
              My feeling is that this will be the beginning of a journey of learning not the end.
              </p>
              <h3>Sketches</h3>

              <p>
                I'm still working out the exact shapes and sizes these things will be. My work process always involves some improv as I develop the concept.
                </p>
                <h3>Breakdown of tasks</h3>
                <p>
                  I will use Illustrator to make a design that I will laser cut out of a solid yet flexible material (still undecided).<br>
                  The base will modelled in a CAD program and 3D printed.<br>
                  The light source will be either a bulb or a small flat seated light similar to the one I used in the lamp project.<br>
                  The spinning mechanism will either be a ball bearing or, I may use a motorized spinning part. Time constraints will probably determine the answer to that.<br>
                  </p>

                  <h3>Timeline</h3>
                  <p>The next steps will be:<br>
                    1. Create a design in Illustrator with a sequence of images.<br>
                    2. Laser cut a test piece of the cutout design.<br>
                    3. Research a material that would work well for that piece (cardstock, vellum, etc)<br>
                    4. Think about how the laser cut part will fit into the base.<br>
                    5. Design the base that holds the light source in a CAD program.<br>
                    6. 3D print the base.<br>
                    7. Assemble and test.

                    <h3>Contingencies</h3>
                    <p>
                    If I start running out of time I will simplify as much as possible to create a cool lighted effect on the wall without being too concerned about achieving an animated look. I will also potentially make the base as simple and straightforward in design rather than a decorative element that I would like to achieve. Using a ball bearing and a simple light without a cord are also part of my contingency plan but are likely going to be necessary.
