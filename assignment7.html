            <h2>Light projected zoetrope</h2>

            <h3>The concept</h3>
            <p>
              In the lamp project and the moving parts project I came across things I wanted to explore further. In particular, reflected light and spinning motion.

            <p>
              While working on the moving parts project I had thought about making a zoetrope (device that produces the illusion of motion by displaying a sequence of drawings or photographs showing progressive phases of that motion). Zoetropes use a similar technology to a flip book, but they possess a circular shape and a strobe light to shine on each image as it rapidly passes by. Because you are looking through a cut out slit for each image, it turns into a frame rate which animates the images.
              <br>
              Additionally, the reflected light that was a by-product of my lantern actually became the most interesting part of my lamp. So as I was brainstorming I ended up with this idea to play with projected light and motion.
              I started by putting my previous project parts together to see what effects I could produce.
