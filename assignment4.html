            Brainstorming cool movement - Ball bearings have always been one of my favorite moving parts and I wanted to make something that spins and has the potential to spin very fast without much effort. I thought about mechanisms and toys that do that and decided to make my own table top adaptation of a fidget spinner.

            <h2>Step 1: Measurements and Setup</h2>
            <p>
            I started by measuring my ball bearing part to see what the dimensions of the inner cutout circle would need to be on my design and also the thickness I would need to make my design to house the ball bearing properly.
