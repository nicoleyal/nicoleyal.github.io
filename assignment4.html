            Brainstorming cool movement - Ball bearings have always been one of my favorite moving parts and I wanted to make something that spins and has the potential to spin very fast without much effort. I thought about mechanisms and toys that do that and decided to make my own table top adaptation of a fidget spinner.

            <h2>Step 1: Measurements and Setup</h2>
            <p>
            I started by measuring my ball bearing part to see what the dimensions of the inner cutout circle would need to be and also the thickness I would need to make my design in order to house the ball bearing properly.

            <p>
            Looking at the thickness of the ball bearing and the thickness of the Delrin options, I decided I would need to make two pieces fastened together.

            <h2>Step 2: Working in Onshape</h2>
            <p>
            I made a circle the size of the cutout and then a larger circle that would become the outside suface of my shape.

            <p>
            Then I made a circle to trim out of the larger circle and copied that 4 times. I was so thrilled with the dimension tool because it made it really easy to position the circles exactly where I wanted them. The trim tool also worked very easily.
