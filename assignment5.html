              <h2>Getting Started</h2>
              <p>
            This assignment was challenging due to the constraints of the material and the box requirement. I started by looking at box designs and corner joints. I was inspired by a few things that were too complicated for the scope of this project, so I measured the FR1 and started sketching out the basic size and shape.
              </p>
              <img src="A5 photos/1.jpg" width=400 hspace="20"><img src="A5 photos/2.jpg" width=600><br>
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p>
              I experimented with several ways of joining the sides.
              </p>

                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
              After drawing up the plan I realized I should make a cardboard prototype to test my measurements so I found a piece of cardboard that happened to be about as thick as the FR1 and started mapping out my shapes. Then I cut them out with a utility knife.
              </p>
              <img src="A5 photos/6.jpg" width=400 hspace="20"><img src="A5 photos/7.jpg" width=400 hspace="20"><img src="A5 photos/8.jpg" width=400><br>
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p>
              When I put my cardboard protoype box together I realized I had subtracted the width of the material on the top and bottom when I actually needed to add it. So I went back to my cardboard and adjusted the measurements to cut a new piece.

              <br>
            <h2>Onshape</h2>
            <p>
            I started with my first side by making a rectangle and adding shapes using the dimension tool to specify the relationships.

            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
            Something went wrong with my sketch 1 but I wasn't sure how to fix it and so I continued thinking I'd come back to it. Spoiler alert: I forgot to come back and I had to re-mill those 2 sides.<br>
            I extruded the shape and filleted the corners and then made a copy using the transform tool.
            </p>
            <img src="A5 photos/3.png" width=600 hspace="20"><img src="A5 photos/4.png" width=600><br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
            I continued working on the other sides and doing the same process.
            </p>
            <img src="A5 photos/5.png" width=600 hspace="20"><img src="A5 photos/6.png" width=600><br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
            I found a problem with my measurements based on how the two pieces were not matching up, so I figured out what I did wrong and adjusted the numbers.
            </p>
            <img src="A5 photos/7.png" width=600 hspace="20"><img src="A5 photos/9.png" width=600><br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
            I continued working on the other sides and doing the same process. Until I had created all sides. Unfortunately I couldn't figure out how to mate the parts and I was running out of time.

            <h2>The Mill at the Mill</h2>
            <p>
            I left work in the middle of the day to get to the Mill to cut my pieces. Shoutout to Lukas who helped ground me as I got started! Things looked good until I took my piece out and for some odd reason the outside edge and one of my slots was milled all the way through, but the other 7 only went halfway through. I know I had unchecked "trace" but thought maybe it got turned back on somehow? Anyway, for the second one I adjusted my Z placement and checked twice that the trace option was unchecked.
            </p>
            <img src="A5 photos/11.jpg" width=400 hspace="20"><img src="A5 photos/13.jpg" width=400><br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
            The next one worked perfectly and things rolled along. Until I think I missed some tape and there was a dusty piece left on there that messed up the adhesion and I ended up with a piece getting mangled a little at the end when the FR1 came loose in the mill.
            </p>
            <img src="A5 photos/12.jpg" width=400 hspace="20">

            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
            So at this point I had cut all of my pieces and found out that something was off. Then the unresolved sketch in Onshape popped back into my head! Ugh, I was out of FR1 and worse, out of time. I had to pick up my kids from school so I left the Mill and decided I would get back into Onshape and solve the problem when I got home.
            </p>
            <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
            <p>
            This part turned out to be a blessing in disguise because I ended up learning more about Onshape. After a lot of deleting dimensions and finding the source of the problem, I figured out that the problem started when I copied and pasted one of the slot rectangles. This is a design software habit that DOES NOT translate to Onshape. I made a new rectangle plus made all of my slots bigger since the tabs weren't fitting well into them.
            </p>
            <img src="A5 photos/12.png" width=600 hspace="20"><img src="A5 photos/13.png" width=600 hspace="20"><br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
            I learned how to move things together and found another discrepancy in the height of the sides. Gosh this was a lot of math problem-solving! I enjoyed it in a weird way.
            </p>
            <img src="A5 photos/14.png" width=600 hspace="20"><img src="A5 photos/15.png" width=600 hspace="20"><br>
            <p>
            I called the Mill to see if there was any FR1 in the back and then headed back to the Mill after work and before class to re-cut the pieces that needed adjustments.
