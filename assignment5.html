              <h2>Getting Started</h2>
              <p>
            This assignment was challenging due to the constraints of the material and the box requirement. I started by looking at box designs and corner joints. I was inspired by a few things that were too complicated for the scope of this project, so I measured the FR1 and started sketching out the basic size and shape.
              </p>
              <img src="A5 photos/1.jpg" width=400 hspace="20"><img src="A5 photos/2.jpg" width=600><br>
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p>
              I experimented with several ways of joining the sides.
              </p>
              <img src="A5 photos/4.jpg" width=400 hspace="20"><img src="A5 photos/3.jpg" width=600 hspace="20"><img src="A5 photos/5.jpg" width=400><br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
              After drawing up the plan I realized I should make a cardboard prototype to test my measurements so I found a piece of cardboard that happened to be about as thick as the FR1 and started mapping out my shapes. Then I cut them out with a utility knife.
              </p>
              <img src="A5 photos/6.jpg" width=400 hspace="20"><img src="A5 photos/7.jpg" width=400 hspace="20"><img src="A5 photos/8.jpg" width=400><br>
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p>
              When I put my cardboard protoype box together I realized I had subtracted the width of the material on the top and bottom when I actually needed to add it. So I went back to my cardboard and adjusted the measurements to cut a new piece.
              </p>

              <br>
              <br>

            <p>
            I started with my first side by making a rectangle and adding shapes using the dimension tool to specify the relationships.
            </p>
            <img src="A5 photos/1.png" width=400 hspace="20"><img src="A5 photos/2.png" width=600><br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
            Something went wrong with my sketch 1 but I wasn't sure how to fix it and so I continued thinking I'd come back to it. Spoiler alert: I forgot to come back and I had to re-mill those 2 sides.<br>
            I extruded the shape and filleted the corners and then made a copy using the transform tool.
            </p>
            <img src="A5 photos/3.png" width=400 hspace="20"><img src="A5 photos/4.png" width=600><br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
            I continued working on the other sides and doing the same process.
            </p>
            <img src="A5 photos/5.png" width=400 hspace="20"><img src="A5 photos/6.png" width=600><br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
            I found a problem with my measurements based on how the two pieces were not matching up, so I figured out what I did wrong and adjusted the numbers.
