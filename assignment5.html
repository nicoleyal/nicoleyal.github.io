              <h2>Getting Started</h2>
              <p>
            This assignment was challenging due to the constraints of the material and the box requirement. I started by looking at box designs and corner joints. I was inspired by a few things that were too complicated for the scope of this project, so I measured the FR1 and started sketching out the basic size and shape.

              <p>
              I experimented with several ways of joining the sides.

              <p>
              After drawing up the plan I realized I should make a cardboard prototype to test my measurements so I found a piece of cardboard that happened to be about as thick as the FR1 and started mapping out my shapes. Then I cut them out with a utility knife.
              </p>
              <img src="A5 photos/6.jpg" width=400 hspace="20"><img src="A5 photos/7.jpg" width=400 hspace="20"><img src="A5 photos/8.jpg" width=400><br>
              <p>
              When I put my cardboard protoype box together I realized I had subtracted the width of the material on the top and bottom when I actually needed to add it. Phew!
