            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            </p>
            <p>
              The process began by absorbing a lot of new information and steps. It was very helpful to go to the Mill and watch classmates with more experience (yay Hannah!) using the laser cutter. I got to witness some troubleshooting.<br>
              I measured my cardboard and began brainstorming for the design.

              <h2>Friday Night at the Mill</h2>
              <p>
                I headed back to the Mill on Friday night and found a very peaceful setting to work on my project. The staff was super friendly and helpful.<br>
                I got out my calipers and measured my cardboard again to make the correct sized notches.

                <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
                <p>
                  After following the steps in the slides VERY closely, I hooked up to the laser cutter and hit the final print button and nothing happened. A staff member came over and helped me discover that I had to hit the left corner placement in the Illustrator print dialog box. It was a simple fix and then my project showed up on the printer!
