            <h2>Step 1: Getting Started</h2>
            </p>
            <p>
              The process began by absorbing a lot of new information and steps in class. It was very helpful to go to the Mill and watch classmates with more experience (yay Hannah!) using the laser cutter.<br>
              I got to witness some troubleshooting which was very helpful. I measured my cardboard and began brainstorming for the design.

              <h2>Step 2: Friday Night at the Mill</h2>
              <p>
                I headed back to the Mill on Friday night and found a very peaceful setting to work on my project. The staff was super friendly and helpful.<br>
                I got out my calipers and measured my cardboard again to make the correct sized notches.

                <h2>Step 3: Troubleshooting</h2>
                <p>
                  After following the steps in the slides VERY closely, I hooked up to the laser cutter and hit the final print button and nothing happened.<br>
                  I called a staff member over and she helped me discover that I had to hit the left corner placement in the Illustrator print dialog box. I was so happy that it was such a simple fix and then my project showed up on the printer!

                <h2>Step 4: True Test of Quality</h2>
                <p>
                  When I brought my pieces home, my five year old jumped right into building with them. They stuck together easily for her.<br>
                  This seemed like a pretty good success metric.
