            <h1>Assignment 1: Laser Cut Press Fit Construction Kit!</h1>
            <p>

            <h2>Step 1: Getting Started</h2>
            </p>
            <p>
              The process began by absorbing a lot of new information and steps in class. It was very helpful to go to the Mill and watch classmates with more experience (thank you to Hannah!) using the laser cutter.<br>
              I got to witness some troubleshooting when the laser cutter didn't recognize the Illustrator file which was very helpful. I measured my cardboard and began brainstorming for the design.

              <h2>Step 2: Friday Night at the Mill</h2>
              <p>
                I headed back to the Mill on Friday night and found a very peaceful setting to work on my project. The staff was super friendly and helpful.<br>
                I got out my calipers and measured my cardboard again to make the correct sized notches.

              <br>
                <h2>Step 3: Troubleshooting</h2>
                <p>
                  After following the steps in the slides VERY closely, I hooked up to the laser cutter and hit the final print button and...nothing happened.<br>
                  I called a staff member over and she helped me discover that I had to hit the left corner placement in the Illustrator print dialog box.<br>

                  <h2>Step 4: Printing</h2>
                  <p>
                   I was so happy that it was such a simple fix and then my project showed up on the printer and it worked!

              <br>

                <h2>Step 5: Quality Testing</h2>
                <p>
                  When I brought my pieces home, my five year old jumped right into building with them. The pieces stuck together easily for her and she was having fun and staying interested for quite awhile.<br>
                   This seemed like a pretty good success metric.

                  <br>
                  <br>

                    <h2>Step 6: Building and Testing for Sturdiness</h2>
                    <p>
                     I played with my pieces and made circular forms and towers that stayed together even when lifted into the air and shaken lightly!<br>
                     My daughter says it looks like a flower tower.

                     <h2>SUCCESS!!!</h2>
                     <br>
                     <br>

                     <h2>Machine Settings</h2>
                     <p>
                      I used 100% power and 25% speed for the machine settings.
