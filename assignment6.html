              Googling molding and casting, I found a cute idea to cast and mold a donut. My intention was to make something fun to paint and play with for my daughter. I started by trying to create a donut on my own in Rhino.

              This wasn't going well with my limited skills in Rhino, so I went to Thingiverse to see if I could find an STL file. I did find one and then I opened that in Rhino. I made the box by making two rectangles, extruding and capping them and using boolean difference to subtract the one cube out of the other. Then I placed the donut in the box.<br>
              I used the ghosting function to see through the side and make sure my donut was lined up perfectly.

                Then I opened my file in Fusion 360 and made a toolpath.

                Things were going smooth until I noticed the Othermill post processor was not installed in my Fusion 360. It was extra confusing because the interface looked 100% different from the demonstration in class due to different operating systems. I used the link from our slides, but I could not find instructions anywhere and something that seemed like it should be easy turned into a very frustrating experience. The only "instructions" in the help guide were to install it - not telling how to do it! I kept googling until I found a forum where people were discussing this task and found the folder path that the file needed to be placed in. Unfortunately once again the wasted time with trivial but necessary tasks caused a lot of unhappiness because my family was waiting for me to watch a movie with them (this was Saturday night). Once I found it and installed it, I felt a ittle better but wished this had been explained, so I put the folder path in Slack in case this was happening to anyone else.

                I created the gcode for the toolpath and opened that in Bantam. I had to do some moving around but eventually I got the donut in the right place. I had to move it down into the material.

              <p>
                Once I knew that was ready I went back to Rhino and flipped the donut to do the other side. I followed all of the same steps and made a toolpath in Fusion 360 for this piece too.

              I decided to get my wax from Comotion as we had been told it was coming soon. So after a dinner date Friday night, I drove over to Seattle with my husband and got there right when they were closing. Fortunately I was able to get my wax and the nice staff member cut it in half for me so I could make two molds. Nadya sent a Slack message saying she would have office hours on Sunday and cut everyone's toolpaths on the Shop Bot. Life seemed to be good not knowing what unfortunate events lied ahead.<br>

                I drove to Seattle on Sunday with full intentions of getting there before 2:00 but when I got into my car the gas tank was empty so I had to stop for gas, so I arrived at Comotion around 2:07. Another student was waiting outside and we could not get in. We didn't know that you have to do the safety training in order to activate your card to access the building. We were sending Slack messages to say we needed to get in, to no avail. Within the next 10 minutes a group of students formed and we finally got lucky when a staff member showed up for work and we went in with him. Getting into the makerspace, there was already quite a large line and each file needed a little attention the process was going slower than planned. I decided to mill my own piece. That's when things got really frustrating. I tried to ask a simple question to make sure my toolpath was not positioned too far down which led to one piece of bad news after another. <br>
                <br>
                1. Nadya suggested I move my design up in the box that I made in Rhino so there wouldn't be so much extra chipping away of material to speed up the milling process and be more efficient. Logical and should be easy. I successfully moved the donut up but when I tried really hard (about 10 times) to make a new rectangle and use boolean difference, it was still showing space under the donut instead of it being submerged halfway.<br>
                <br>
                2. It was pointed out to me that I didn't have the right dimensions for the wax in Bantam so I measured and fixed those. But now the strange thing is that the display in Bantam did not show the correct proportions. My toolpath/design looked much smaller than it should have looked in comparison to the wax. At this point I'm really needing some help. THEN:<br>
                <br>
                3. In order to troubleshoot, I tried to position my wax in the Othermill to see if the wax looked the same size as the display in Bantam only to find out that the wax we bought from Comotion is too tall for the Mill!<br>
                <br>
                4. I realized that there was no way my toolpath would be cut within 4 hours by Nadya with my position in line. I also didn't get my wax cut to the correct size, so I left with no progress. I had actually gone backwards from where I was when I went in.
