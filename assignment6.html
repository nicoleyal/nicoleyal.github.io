              Googling molding and casting, I found a cute idea to cast and mold a donut. My intention was to make something fun to paint and play with for my daughter. I started by trying to create a donut on my own in Rhino.

              This wasn't going well with my limited skills in Rhino, so I went to Thingiverse to see if I could find an STL file. I did find one and then I opened that in Rhino. I made the box by making two rectangles, extruding and capping them and using boolean difference to subtract the one cube out of the other. Then I placed the donut in the box.<br>
              I used the ghosting function to see through the side and make sure my donut was lined up perfectly.

                Then I opened my file in Fusion 360 and made a toolpath.

                Things were going smooth until I noticed the Othermill post processor was not installed in my Fusion 360. It was extra confusing because the interface looked 100% different from the demonstration in class due to different operating systems. I used the link from our slides, but I could not find instructions anywhere and something that seemed like it should be easy turned into a very frustrating experience. The only "instructions" in the help guide were to install it - not telling how to do it! I kept googling until I found a forum where people were discussing this task and found the folder path that the file needed to be placed in. Unfortunately once again the wasted time with trivial but necessary tasks caused a lot of unhappiness because my family was waiting for me to watch a movie with them (this was Friday night). Once I found it and installed it, I felt a ittle better but wished this had been explained, so I Slacked the folder path in case this was happening to anyone else.
