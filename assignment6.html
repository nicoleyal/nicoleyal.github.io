            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>
              I searched for molding and casting ideas and found a cute idea to cast and mold a donut. My intention was to make something fun to paint and play with for my daughter. And who doesn't love a cute donut?
            </p>

            <p>
            I started by trying to create a donut on my own in Rhino.
            </p>

              <br>
            <p>
              This wasn't going well with my limited skills in Rhino, so I went to Thingiverse to see if I could find an STL file. I did find one and then I opened that in Rhino. I made the box by making two rectangles, extruding and capping them and using boolean difference to subtract the one cube out of the other. Then I placed the donut in the box.<br>
              I used the ghosting function to see through the side and make sure my donut was lined up perfectly.

              <br>
              <p>
                Then I opened my file in Fusion 360 and made a toolpath. I had to figure out what many different error messages meant, but I was successful.
              </p>
              <img src="A6 photos/5.png" width=600 hspace="20"><img src="A6 photos/6.png" width=600 hspace="20">

              <p>
                Things were going smooth until I noticed the Othermill post processor was not installed in my Fusion 360. It was extra confusing because the interface looked 100% different from the demonstration in class due to different operating systems. I used the link from our slides, but I could not find instructions anywhere and something that seemed like it should be easy turned into a very frustrating experience. I kept googling until I found a forum where people were discussing this task and found the folder path that the file needed to be placed in. I put the folder path in Slack in case this was happening to anyone else.
              </p>
              <img src="A6 photos/11.png" width=600 hspace="20"><img src="A6 photos/7.png" width=600 hspace="20">
              <br>
              <br>
              <p>
                I created the gcode for the toolpath and opened that in Bantam. I had to do some moving around but eventually I got the donut in the right place. I had to move it down into the material.
              </p>

              <br>
              <br>
              <p>
                Once I knew that was ready, I went back to Rhino and flipped the donut to do the other side. I followed all of the same steps and made a toolpath in Fusion 360 for this piece too.
              </p>

              I decided to get my wax from Comotion as it seemed that might arrive faster than ordering it. So after a dinner date Friday night, I drove over to Seattle with my husband and got there right when they were closing. Fortunately I was able to get my wax and the nice staff member cut it in half for me so I could make two molds. Nadya sent a Slack message saying she would have office hours on Sunday and cut everyone's toolpaths on the Shop Bot. Life seemed to be good.... not knowing what unfortunate events lied ahead.<br>
              </p>
              <img src="A6 photos/danger-ahead.jpg" width=400 hspace="20">
              <br>
              <br>
              <p>
                I drove to Seattle on Sunday with full intentions of getting there before 2:00 but had to stop for gas, so I arrived at Comotion around 2:07. Another student was waiting outside and we could not get in. We didn't know that you have to do the safety training in order to activate your card to access the building. We were sending Slack messages to say we needed to get in, to no avail. Within the next 10 minutes a group of students formed and we finally got lucky when a staff member showed up for work and we went in with him. Getting into the makerspace, there was already quite a large line and each file needed attention so the process was going slower than planned. I decided to mill my own piece while I was there. That's when things got really frustrating. I asked a simple question to make sure my toolpath was not positioned too far down which led to a death spiral of things not working. <br>
                <br>
                1. Nadya suggested I move my design up in the box that I made in Rhino so there wouldn't be so much extra chipping away of material to speed up the milling process and be more efficient. Logical and should be easy. I successfully moved the donut up but when I tried really hard (about 10 times) to make a new rectangle and use boolean difference, it was still showing space under the donut instead of it being submerged halfway.<br>
                <br>
                2. It was pointed out to me that I didn't have the right dimensions for the wax in Bantam so I measured and fixed those. But now, strangely, the display in Bantam did not show the correct proportions. My toolpath/design looked much smaller than it should have looked in comparison to the wax. At this point I'm really needing some help. But wait, it gets worse.<br>
                <br>
                3. In order to troubleshoot, I tried to position my wax in the Othermill to check if the wax matched the display in Bantam only to find out that the wax we bought from Comotion is too tall for the mill!<br>
                <br>
                4. I realized that there was no way my toolpath would be cut within 4 hours by Nadya with my position in line. I also didn't get my wax cut to the correct size, so I left with no progress after 3 hours. I had actually gone backwards from where I was when I went in because my file was broken and my wax was not the right size for me to mill on my own.

              <h2>Re-grouping</h2>
                <p>
                Now that I was heading into the work week, I had to consider how I would approach the next step. Realizing that a two part mold was probably not a great idea with the lost time, I decided to make a plan B. I search Thingiverse for birds and found something that I really liked.
                </p>
                <img src="A6 photos/Thingiverse_screenshot.png" width=400 hspace="20">

                <br>
                <p>
                I started considering 3D printing, but I still wanted to try milling and I had already bought the machinable wax and cut it in half unfortunately (to make two molds), so I opened Fusion 360. There were two parts that I had to remove that I didn't want in my piece and I had to resize it to fit into my wax. I then created a toolpath to get it ready to mill.
                </p>
              </p>
              <img src="A6 photos/bird in Fusion .png" width=600 hspace="20"><img src="A6 photos/bird in Bantam.png" width=600 hspace="20">
              <br>
              <br>
               <p>
                Then I found out that Nadya would not be cutting anyone else's pieces, and I kept thinking I could try to do it right before class, but my wax was still too tall. So I felt pretty defeated and started thinking about going back to 3D printing. I wasn't sure if I would be able to get this done because it is not easy for me to get to the makerspace multiple times a week. Fortunately I remembered seeing a 3D printer being built in our kitchen at work. I searched the office and found it and asked if I could use it. Phew! Project saved! It was an awesomely smooth printing process and I love the result. The only thing that turned out different was the size of the bird. For some reason when I exported the gcode it didn't save my scaling. No problem though.

                <br>
                <p>
                Then it was time to get to work building my mold. I used the rice technique to get an idea of how much I needed (thanks Leo!). I mixed the two parts of the OOMO and poured it in the plastic container over my piece. No trouble there other than trying to find big enough containers for both.
                </p>
                <img src="A6 photos/bird molding/IMG_5113.jpg" width=600 hspace="20"><img src="A6 photos/bird molding/IMG_5115.jpg" width=400 hspace="20"><img src="A6 photos/bird molding/IMG_5116.jpg" width=400 hspace="20">
                <p>
                The mold worked fine except for a little rubber that went under my piece which I was able to trim off with my utility knife.
                </p>

                I think a scalpel would have created a nicer edge but it worked enough for my purposes.

                <img src="A6 photos/bird molding/IMG_5121.jpg" width=800 hspace="20">
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                I filled the mold with some plaster that I had at home.
                </p>

                <p>
                The finished bird came out great. I wasn't sure how the eye would work but it slid right off of the mold.
                </p>

                <br>
                <p>
                I experimented with adding food coloring to the plaster mix.
