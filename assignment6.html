            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>
              Googling molding and casting, I found a cute idea to cast and mold a donut. My intention was to make something fun to paint and play with for my daughter. I started by trying to create a donut on my own in Rhino.

              This wasn't going well with my limited skills in Rhino, so I went to Thingiverse to see if I could find an STL file. I did find one and then I opened that in Rhino. I made the box by making two rectangles, extruding them and using boolean difference to subtract the one cube out of the other. Then I placed the donut in the box.<br>
              I used the ghosting function to see through the side and make sure my donut was lined up perfectly.

                Then I opened my file in Fusion 360 and made a toolpath.
