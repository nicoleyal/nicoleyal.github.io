            My name is Nicole. I'm an HCDE masters student and I'm excited to learn how to use some of the tools that I haven't used in makerspaces. Sculpture was my focus in my undergrad art degree. I have done a lot of woodworking and metal work such as pouring bronze and welding. I've also worked with clay a lot. I'm excited to learn how to use digitally operated tools! I'm not sure if that's even the correct way to describe them. ha
