            My name is Nicole. I'm an HCDE masters student and I'm excited to learn how to use some of the tools that I haven't used before in makerspaces.<br>
            Sculpture was my focus in my undergrad art degree. I have done a lot of woodworking and metal work such as casting and pouring bronze and welding. I've also done many different styles of clay work.<br>
            I worked as a designer with a sign shop in New York that specialized in vehicle and truck wraps and other unusual signs so I've worked with large-scale vinyl in that capacity.<br>
            I'm excited to learn how to operate tools using coding.
            Another thing I'm excited about is using my extensive experience working with vectors in a new way and helping others work with vectors.
