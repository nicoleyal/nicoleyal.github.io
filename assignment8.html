          <h2>Inspiration</h2>
          <p>
            My inspiration for this project came from two of our previous projects in this class. In the lamp project and the moving parts project I became fascinated with projected light and spinning motion.<br>
            <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            While working on the moving parts project I had thought about making a zoetrope which is a device that produces the illusion of motion by displaying a sequence of images showing progressive phases of that motion.<br>
            So for my final project I decided to pursue the zoetrope concept in a different way using projected light.<br>
            <br>
            <h2>Testing the concept with a prototype</h2>
            I started by making a prototype to test my concept. I found some thick black posterboard and made a mark every 2 inches. I drew a sequence of triangles progressively rotating every 2 inches and cut them out with my utility knife.<br>
            <br>
            <img src="A8 photos/prototype pics/IMG_5190.jpg" width=400 hspace="20"><img src="A8 photos/prototype pics/IMG_5191.jpg" width=400 hspace="20"><img src="A8 photos/prototype pics/IMG_5164.jpg" width=400 hspace="20"><br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Then I found a dark little nook under my desk which became my testing studio for the rest of the project. I experimented with different types and placement of light including standard lightbulbs, flashlights and small cordless lights.<br>
            I took notes about what I learned and what I wanted to try.<br>
            <br>

            <br>
            Through more experimenting I reached a point of satisfaction with my prototype and had enough insights and information to move on.<br>

            <h2>Creating the visual element</h2>
            <p>
            I started by searching the word zoetrope online and it was quite a fun rabbithole. I found this cool webpage that had interesting history information and cool images <a href="https://boingboing.net/2015/12/11/this-zoetrope-will-have-you-me.html"><p>https://boingboing.net/2015/12/11/this-zoetrope-will-have-you-me.html</p></a><br>
            I chose to download a file to modify for my project.<br>
            <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            I used Photoshop to crop the image to the part I wanted to use, so I could simplify it and turn it into a vector file in Illustrator. I used the tracing function in Illustrator to make a silhouette of the image and tweaked it to my liking and then expanded the tracing to form a path. I then changed the stroke weight to .001 to prepare this file for laser cutting.

            <h2>Planning out the base</h2>
              I started by sketching and brainstorming the shape of the base. All of the research I had done showed me that the bases were always very decorative on the classic zoetropes. I explored that direction with some fails before having a late night epiphany that I should just use a base that is the same diameter as the spinning part in order to make it more stable.<br>
              <br>
            <img src="A8 photos/notes1.jpg" width=400 hspace="20"><img src="A8 photos/notes2.jpg" width=400 hspace="20"><br>
            <br>
            I took measurements to begin creating my design.<br>
            <br>
            <img src="A8 photos/prototype pics/IMG_5192.jpg" width=400 hspace="20"><img src="A8 photos/IMG_5211.jpg" width=400 hspace="20"><br>
            <img src="A8 photos/IMG_5206.jpg" width=200 hspace="20"><img src="A8 photos/IMG_5207.jpg" width=200 hspace="20"><img src="A8 photos/IMG_5208.jpg" width=200 hspace="20"><img src="A8 photos/IMG_5209.jpg" width=200 hspace="20"><br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Some very focused mathematical moments followed. After obsessing over how to make an affordance for spinning, I thought of an idea to make the top circle smaller with notches that extend out to the diameter of the bottom base circle. This was a visually pleasing and functional solution so I was proud of this. I eventually ended up with a list of pieces that I would need to create in CAD and laser cut and 3D print.<br>
            <br>
            <img src="A8 photos/notes3.jpg" width=400 hspace="20"><img src="A8 photos/notes4.jpg" width=400 hspace="20"><br>
            <br>
            <h2>Making the CAD files</h2>
            I started in Onshape by creating the 2 pieces for the base. One that is stationary on the bottom and the spinning piece. I made a cutout for holding the ball bearing on the top part and then a cutout for the piece that holds the ball bearing on the bottom base part which I call the connector part.<br>
            <br>
            <img src="A8 photos/Onshape1.png" width=400 hspace="20"><img src="A8 photos/Onshape2.png" width=400 hspace="20"><img src="A8 photos/Onshape4.png" width=400 hspace="20"><br>
            <br>
            When my pieces were ready I exported each part as a DXF file to import into Illustrator to prepare for lasercutting.<br>
            <br>
            <img src="A8 photos/Onshape5.png" width=600 hspace="20"><br>
            <br>
            <br>
            The next step was to make the connector part to connect the ball bearing that allows the piece to spin. After failing miserably trying to make it in Onshape, I ended up creating the part very quickly and easily in Rhino to my delight! I exported it as an STL and then opened it in the Digilab software to 3D print.<br>
            <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Adventures at the Mill</h2>
            I was fortunate to get to the Mill before the line for the laser cutter got really long. I was also lucky that my 3D printing could be set up while I was waiting for my turn on the laser cutter. So timing worked in my favor for once. :)<br>
            My first 3D print failed due to poor layer adhesion, so I tried again increasing the temperature of the nozzle and the platform. (Settings below)

            <br>

            <br>
            Laser cutting went well too aside from one of the circles on my wood did not cut all the way through. I had to go over it about 4 times tweaking the speed settings each time in order to get it to cut all the way through.<br>

            I also found this very cool video called "Brilliant Geometry" on YouTube which inspired me for light placement as well as many other things. It's long so you might want to check it out later.<br>

        <h2>Laser settings</h2>
        <p>
          Black posterboard:<br>
          Speed 80%<br>
          Power 40%<br>
          Frequency 50<br>

          <br>
          1/4 inch wood:
          Speed 3%<br>
          Power 100%<br>
          Frequency 10<br>
          I had to adjust the speed setting for the laser to cut all the way through one of the circles for some reason - I tried 8% and then went up to 10%<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>3D printer settings</h2>
          <p>
            For the 3D print I used ABS filament that the Mill had on hand. The first try was a failure at 220 degrees for the nozzle and 45 degrees for the platform. I had problems with layer adhesion and the piece fell apart.<br>

            For the second attempt I used 230 degrees for the nozzle and 50 degrees for the platform. It was still a very weak piece and eventually fell apart. Next time I would try a better quality 3D printer and possibly increase the quality setting which would take longer but may be what is needed for this piece.<br>
