          <h2>The process</h2>
          <p>
            My inspiration for this project comes from two of our previous projects in this class. In the lamp project and the moving parts project I became fascinated with projected light and spinning motion.<br>
            <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            While working on the moving parts project I had thought about making a zoetrope which is a device that produces the illusion of motion by displaying a sequence of images showing progressive phases of that motion.<br>
            So for my final project I decided to pursue the zoetrope concept in a different way using projected light.<br>
            <br>
            <h2>The Prototype</h2>
            I started by making a prototype to test my concept. I found some thick black posterboard and made a mark every 2 inches. I drew a sequence of triangles progressively rotating every 2 inches and cut them out with my utility knife.<br>
            <br>
            <img src="A8 photos/prototype pics/IMG_5190.jpg" width=400 hspace="20"><img src="A8 photos/prototype pics/IMG_5191.jpg" width=400 hspace="20"><img src="A8 photos/prototype pics/IMG_5164.jpg" width=400 hspace="20"><br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Then I found a dark little nook under my desk which became my testing studio for the rest of the project. I experimented with different types and placement of light including standard lightbulbs, flashlights and small cordless lights.<br>
            <br>
            <img src="A8 photos/prototype pics/IMG_5169.jpg" width=400 hspace="20"><img src="A8 photos/prototype pics/IMG_5171.jpg" width=400 hspace="20"><br>
            <br>
            After that I started taking measurements to begin creating my design.<br>
            <br>

            <img src="A8 photos/IMG_5206.jpg" width=200 hspace="20"><img src="A8 photos/IMG_5207.jpg" width=200 hspace="20"><img src="A8 photos/IMG_5208.jpg" width=200 hspace="20"><img src="A8 photos/IMG_5209.jpg" width=200 hspace="20"><br>
            <br>
            <br>



            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>
            I started by searching the word zoetrope online and it was quite a fun rabbithole. I found this cool webpage that had interesting history information and cool images <a href="https://boingboing.net/2015/12/11/this-zoetrope-will-have-you-me.html"><p>https://boingboing.net/2015/12/11/this-zoetrope-will-have-you-me.html</p></a><br>
            I chose to download a file to modify for my project.<br>
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>
            I also found this very cool video called "Brilliant Geometry" on YouTube which was very inspiring. It's long so you might want to check it out later.<br>

            <br>
            <h2>Putting the concept in motion</h2>
            I used Photoshop to crop the image to the part I wanted to use, so I could simplify it and turn it into a vector file in Illustrator.<br>
            <br>

        <p>
          Black posterboard:<br>
          Speed 80%<br>
          Power 40%<br>
          Frequency 50<br>

          <br>
          1/4 inch wood:
          Speed 3%<br>
          Power 100%<br>
          Frequency 10<br>
          I had to adjust the speed setting for the laser to cut all the way through one of the circles for some reason - I tried 8% and then went up to 10%<br>
