              <h2>Step 2: Starting the Parametric Model</h2>
              <p>
              I started by measuring the circles in my existing construction kit so I could make a parametric model.
            </p>
            <img src="A2 photos/measure1-circle.jpg" width=400></a>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
            Then I used the circle component in Grasshopper to make the first part of the shape.
          </p>
            <img src="A2 photos/1gh-start.png" width=600></a>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
            After that I made a rectangle and used number sliders to make the size adjustable. I measured the notch to figure out what size I should make my rectangle.<br>
             I also found an MD (multidimensional) slider which allowed me to move the rectangle around.
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
            I used the polar array component to create a circular array of rectangles and used a number slider for the count to make it adjustable.
            </p>
            <img src="A2 photos/3gh-polar-array.png" width=600 hspace="20"></a>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
            I made 3 more circles and used sliders to move them into the correct positions. I also started using the polar array functions to try to set them in the right places.
            </p>
            <img src="A2 photos/4gh-fullshape-polar-array.png" width=600 hspace="20"></a>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Step 3: Troubleshooting</h2>
            <p>
            I found the correct angles and relative x,y positions for the rectangles, but was left with a tiny adjustment that just wasn't possible with the way I had set things up.
          </p>

          <br>
          <br>
          <p>
          Fortunately, Nadya posted the screencapture just in time, so I learned how to use the Move component. Thank you Nadya!

          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>
          At this point I had everything ready to unite the shapes. Except everything I tried to unite or join the shapes wasn't working.
          </p>
            <img src="A2 photos/7gh-stuck-unite-shapes.png" width=600 hspace="20"></a>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
          <p>
          After a brief meltdown, I decided to bake everything to see if I could unite and trim everything in Rhino.
          </p>
          <img src="A2 photos/9gh-crying.png" width=600 hspace="20"></a>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>
          10 Google searches later, I finally found the right command - Curveboolean
          </p>
          <img src="A2 photos/10gh-curve-boolean.png" width=600 hspace="20"></a>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>
          So I moved the first shape aside and started working on a new one using the second thickness of material.<br>
          Things went more smoothly this time after learning a lot of lessons the first time around.<br>
          I measured my new material and adjusted the size of my rectangles to be a bit bigger to match the thicker material.
          </p>

          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>
          After following the same steps to bake and use the Curveboolean command, I made a linear array of both shapes to get ready to export it to Illustrator.
