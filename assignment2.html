              <h2>Step 2: Starting the Parametric Model</h2>
              <p>
              I started by measuring the circles in my existing construction kit so I could design a parametric model.
            </p>
            <img src="A2 photos/measure1-circle.jpg" width=400></a>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
            Then I used the circle component in Grasshopper to make the first part of the shape.
          </p>
            <img src="A2 photos/1gh-start.png" width=600></a>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
            After that I made a rectangle and used number sliders to make the size adjustable. I measured the notch to figure out what size I should make my rectangle.<br>
             I also found an MD (multidimensional) slider which allowed me to move the rectangle around (and was kinda fun).
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
            I used the polar array component to create a circular array of rectangles and used a number slider for the count to make it adjustable.
            </p>
            <img src="A2 photos/3gh-polar-array.png" width=600 hspace="20"></a>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
            I made 3 more circles and used sliders to move them into the correct positions. I also started using the polar array functions to move the rectangles into the right places.
            </p>
            <img src="A2 photos/4gh-fullshape-polar-array.png" width=600 hspace="20"></a>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Step 3: Troubleshooting</h2>
            <p>
            I found the correct angles and relative x,y positions for the rectangles, but was left with a tiny adjustment that just wasn't possible with the way I had set things up.
          </p>

          <br>
          <br>
          <p>
          Fortunately, Nadya posted the screencapture just in time, so I learned how to use the Move component. Thank you Nadya!
          </p>

          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>
          At this point I had everything ready to unite the shapes. Except everything I tried to unite or join the shapes wasn't working.
          </p>
            <img src="A2 photos/7gh-stuck-unite-shapes.png" width=600 hspace="20"></a>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
          <p>
          After realizing how much time I'd spent and having a brief meltdown, I decided to bake everything to see if I could unite and trim in Rhino.
          </p>
          <img src="A2 photos/9gh-crying.png" width=600 hspace="20"></a>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>
          Even in Rhino I ran into trouble. Lots of frustrating failed attempts and 10 Google searches later, I finally found the right command - Curveboolean which allowed me to unite all of the shapes and select the areas I wanted to trim out all in one step.
          </p>
          <img src="A2 photos/10gh-curve-boolean.png" width=600 hspace="20"></a>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>
          So I moved the first shape aside and started working on a new one using the second thickness of material.<br>
          Things went more smoothly this time after learning a lot of lessons the first time around.<br>
          I measured my new material and adjusted the size of my rectangles to be a bit bigger to match the thicker material.
          </p>
          <img src="A2 photos/measure3-new-thickness.jpg" width=400 hspace="20"></a><img src="A2 photos/11gh-second-thickness.png" width=600 hspace="20"></a>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>
          After following the same steps to bake and use the Curveboolean command, I made a linear array of both shapes to get ready to export it to Illustrator.<br>
          I made separate ai files called "thinner" and "thicker" to distinguish between the two.
          </p>
          <img src="A2 photos/13gh-linear-array2.png" width=600 hspace="20"></a>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>Step 4: Illustrator Problem Solving</h2>
          <p>
            When I opened my Illustrator files I noticed that the default artboard was 8.5 x 11 inches and my shapes looked really tiny on the artboard. So I selected one and looked at the measurements, got out my calipers to have a tangible reference and knew I definitely needed to resize.<br>
            The calipers have really come in handy!
            </p>

             <br>
             <br>
             <br>
             <h2>Step 5: Laser Cutting Lessons</h2>
             <p>
               I made the mistake of thinking this part would be a breeze since I'd done it before. 3 things I learned:<br>
               <br>
               1. Even though you are being careful not to waste cardboard, make sure your design doesn't come too close to the edge of your artboard. Nothing really bad happened but one of the pieces got a bit misshapen by the way the laser moved when it went off the cardboard just a little bit.<br>
               2. If it seems like you might need to tape the cardboard down, just go ahead and do so to be safe. Nothing really bad happened here either but it was a real nail-biter as I saw my cardboard lifting way up on one side from the exhaust fan I think.<br>
               3. Most importantly, do a test piece. I had a really hard time getting the machine to "print" my files this time. There was no explanation for that as the tech at the Mill wasn't sure either. She had to bring me a new laptop and that seemed to help. There was a lot of frustration leading up to that solution and it was Easter Sunday. I made the mistake of thinking everything would be fine because I had no trouble the first time and my measurements were spot on. This time I was very surprised that my notches were bigger than I expected. I couldn't redo everything at that point because I had family waiting at home and I had wasted a bunch of time with the "broken" laptop in the Mill.<br>
               <br>
               It all worked out in the end because the larger shapes fit into the notches on the smaller shapes and two of the smaller pieces put together fit in the bigger piece notches. Oh yeah, that was also a lesson for doing test pieces. I decided to make two sizes of shapes to mix things up. Turns out they don't join very neatly, so I would have adjusted that if time allowed. <br>
               One thing I am proud of is how I managed the large load of photos to make it easy to find the right one once I started this documentation especially since the screenshots are not easy to discern at a quick glance.<br>
               Overall, I learned so much in this project.
