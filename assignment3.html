            After dreaming about awesome lamp designs, I quickly realized that with only one week to do this and the constraints of combining laser and 3D, I would have to scale back to something much less ambitious.

          Picking out what inspired me, I really liked the stars and the curvy shape. The reflection made me think of paper lanterns. I decided to switch from hanging lamp to lantern. So I measured my light and started to brainstorm from there.

        A lot of interesting math adventures followed this step as I was looking to find the diameter of the circle I wanted.

      In Rhino I created a rectangle that would be curled into a cylinder. I made one star in the corner and then created a linear array to fill one line. I then used linear array to fill the whole rectangle. Realizing that didn't look quite like what I wanted, I made the next line of stars slightly moved over to create a pattern and then made another array to fill the whole rectangle.

    <p>
      I also started working on my 3D shape which would be a ring to hold the paper cylinder. I decided to finish the lasercutting part before spending more time on the 3D part, so I exported my rectangle to Illustrator for lasercutting. The lasercutting was successful so I went back to Rhino to finish the 3D part.

        I went back to the Mill on Thursday night for office hours and Joshua was amazing. Very patient and helpful. Rhino is just not intuitive for me and it was a long night trying to figure out the right commands, etc. I finally got a file ready to print and got the printer going. Partway through it started having problems with layer adhesion. I didn't get home until midnight and I knew I had to redo everything.

        In addition to the print fail, my math was off. This was not surprising since I haven't done much math like that in a long time and I have been rushing through each step to try to finish everything that has to be done in one week. I guess I learned that I should slow down and double-check with the planning because it takes longer to redo things. I figured out the correct diameter using the circumference and sketched out a new plan incorporating a base layer instead of just a ring for the 3D part. I also planned to increase my piece to 2mm instead of 1mm to create a little more stability.

        It proved to be much harder to try to modify my existing file, so I had to remake it (probably about 5 or 6 times). The lab tech, Andrew, was super nice and was trying to figure out Rhino commands with me for quite awhile. On my first attempt we could see that the piece was completely filled in instead of having rings on a base. Andrew showed me how to see layer by layer using the xray feature to see what the build will actually look like. Several iterations later, we celebrated when the shape finally appeared properly in Digilab.

      The first attempt didn't stick to the printer, so we stopped that and started over using a raft.

      I had to go home after that started and was looking good. I was so relieved and happy to get the "success" email from the Mill the next day.

        Things turned out pretty well considering all of the hiccups along the way. I made 2 different "shades" for different moods.

        My favorite part is how the light casts shapes onto the walls, ceiling or any other surrounding surface.

        It was hard to capture a good photo of the light and shadows, but here are some more examples.

        This photo felt like a nice connection to my project.
