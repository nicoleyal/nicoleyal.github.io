            After dreaming about awesome lamp designs, I quickly realized that with only one week to do this and the constraints of combining laser and 3D, I would have to scale back to something much less ambitious.

          Picking out what inspired me, I really liked the stars and the curvy shape. The reflection made me think of paper lanterns. I decided to switch from hanging lamp to lantern. So I measured my light and started to brainstorm from there.

        A lot of interesting math adventures followed this step as I was looking to find the diameter of the circle I wanted.

    In Rhino I created a rectangle that would be curled into a cylinder. I made one star in the corner and then created a linear array to fill one line. I made the next line of stars slightly moved over to create a pattern and then made another array to fill the whole rectangle. I also started working on my 3D shape which would be a ring to hold the paper cylinder.

        I decided to finish the lasercutting part before spending more time on the 3D part, so I exported my rectangle to Illustrator for lasercutting. The lasercutting was successful so I went back to Rhino to finish the 3D part.
